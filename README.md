## Article Drafting Assistant (MVP)

An AI-assisted low-code application built with Lovable.dev for the 24-Hour Low-Code Challenge.
The app helps editors turn interview transcripts and supporting sources into story-driven draft articles with human-in-the-loop (HITL) review.

## üöÄ Problem Framing & Assumptions

Editors often need to quickly draft articles from long transcripts and multiple sources.
Manual summarization, source validation, and draft structuring take significant time.

## This MVP assumes:

- Inputs are public transcripts and public supporting sources (e.g., PDFs, URLs, YouTube links).

- Editors prefer a minimal, clean interface with clear HITL controls.

- (one transcript + one or more sources ‚Üí approved points ‚Üí draft ‚Üí export) is the priority.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Frontend / Workflow:

- Built with Lovable.dev (low-code platform).

Pages:

- Start New Project (user enters project title and Brief Description).

- Upload Transcript & Sources.

- Key Point Extraction & Review (deduplicated key points ‚Üí approve/edit/reorder).

- Set Story Direction (tone/angle/length).

- Draft Generation (outline/full draft with source mapping + quote checker).

- Export (Markdown + optional provenance JSON).

## üîë API Integration Notes

During development, I attempted to set up API integration for AI features using an OpenAI API key and Supabase.

Generated an OpenAI API key and tried connecting it with the project.

- Explored Supabase as a backend option.

- Due to connection/configuration issues, the integration was not fully successful.

‚ö†Ô∏è Because of this, two core features were not functional in the current version:

- Key Point Extraction ‚Üí planned feature, but not working due to missing AI integration.

- Quote Checker ‚Üí planned feature, but not working due to missing AI integration.

The rest of the flow (project creation, transcript/source upload, editor controls, and export) is functional.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned vs. Implemented)

- ‚úÖ Project creation with custom title 
- ‚úÖ Upload/paste transcript + attach supporting sources
- ‚úÖ Dark/white theme toggle
- ‚úÖ Export as Markdown (with optional provenance JSON placeholder)
- ‚ùå Key point extraction (not working ‚Äî depends on API)
- ‚ùå Quote checker (not working ‚Äî depends on API)

## Trade-offs Made:

- API integration simulated due to time constraints.

- Key point extraction and quote checker not functional without live API calls.

- Focused on UX clarity and clean editor flow.

## Next Steps:

- Finalize OpenAI + Supabase integration for live AI features.

- Implement deduplication logic for key points.

- Activate quote checker with real source matching.

- Add versioning/checkpoint system.

- Optimize performance for long transcripts (‚â•10k chars).

- Add light test coverage for quote matching.
